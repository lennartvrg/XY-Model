\section{Numerical Methods}
\subsection{Monte Carlo Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate $E$ and $M$ for the initial lattice configuration.
	\item Perform a lattice sweep by iterating over all lattice sites. For every site $i$ do:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Propose a new angle $\theta_i \in [0,2\pi)$ from a uniform distribution.
		\item Calculate $\Delta H = \Delta E$ and $\Delta M$ for the proposed new state.
		\item Accept or reject state with propability $P = \min{(1, \exp{(-\beta\Delta H)})}$
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Update the observables $E \mathrel{{+}{=}} \Delta E$ and $M \mathrel{{+}{=}} \Delta M$ and add them to the result set.
	\item Repeat from 2. for a total of $N$ sweeps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bootstrap Analysis}
Since the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm scales with the number of lattices sites, it is computationally impractical to run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for very long times. To resolve this, one might use bootstrap sampling to obtain more measurements than were simulated.
