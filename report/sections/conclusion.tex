\section{Conclusion}
In this work we were able to simulate the $2$D XY model using a numerical Monte Carlo approach. For this we used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (\cref{sec:metropolis_hastings}), bootstrapping (\cref{sec:bootstrap}) and distributed computing techniques. The simulation ran on the \emph{JSUSUF} cluster at \emph{FZ JÃ¼lich} and helped us study the observables $E$, ${\lvert M \rvert}^2$, $C_V$ and $\chi$.

In~\cref{sec:critical_temperature} we used the shifted temperature  in~\cref{eq:shifted_temperature} to get an estimate for the critical temperature
\begin{equation}
	T_C = \num{0.8941(57)}.
\end{equation}
The uncertainty is the $\SI{95}{\percent}$ confidence band obtained from bootrapping the intercept of our linear regression model using a least square algorithm. As discussed in~\cref{sec:critical_temperature} our estimate is compatible with existing literature.
