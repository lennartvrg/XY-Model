	abstract = {We analyze the transfer matrix of the plane rotator model in d = 1 and 2 dimensions. In 1D we relate the magnetic field susceptibility of the ferromagnet and that of the antiferromagnet. In 2D, we produce some simple transformations that map the problem onto the s = 12 anisotropic Heisenberg chain, thereby reproducing all the known features of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.}

	abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}

The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two‐dimensional rigid‐sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four‐term virial coefficient expansion.},
